# üóÑÔ∏è What Is `EmployeeTable.scala` (Slick Table Mapping)

---

## ‚úÖ What Is a Slick Table?

`EmployeeTable.scala` defines how your **domain model** (e.g. `Employee`) maps to the **actual database table** (`employees` in MySQL).

It is part of the "infrastructure" layer in your domain module ‚Äî connecting your core business model to persistence.

In general terms, it:

- Declares how each **Scala field maps to a database column**
- Defines **primary keys**, **auto-increment fields**, and **nullable values**
- Provides a way for **Slick to generate SQL queries** for your model
- Does **not** contain any business logic ‚Äî it's purely technical

---

## üß© Why Do We Use It?

Slick (your database library) needs this table mapping so it can:

- Know how to **read from** and **write to** the SQL table
- Convert a `ResultSet` row from the DB into an `Employee` object
- Insert or update rows based on your Scala model
- Support auto-generated fields like `id`, `created_at`, etc.

Without this mapping, Slick has no way of knowing:
> ‚ÄúWhich Scala field corresponds to which database column?‚Äù

---

## üß± Example

In your Scala file:

```scala
case class Employee(
  id: Option[Long],
  firstName: String,
  ...
)
```

In the Slick table:

```scala
def id = column[Long]("id", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
```

You then **bind all columns together** with:

```scala
def * = (id.?, firstName, ...) <> (Employee.tupled, Employee.unapply)
```

This is how Slick knows how to "construct" and "deconstruct" your `Employee`.

## üß≠ Why It‚Äôs the Second Step in Domain Setup

After you create the **domain model** (`Employee.scala`), you need to:

1. Tell Slick how to **store and retrieve** that model ‚Äî that‚Äôs the table
2. Only then can you write logic to **insert/query** from the DB
3. Only then can you **add a repository**, which depends on this table

So:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Domain model (your business data shape)
- ‚úÖ Step 2: Table mapping (how it stores in DB)
- üîú Step 3: Repository (how we query/save using Slick)

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Purpose             | `EmployeeTable.scala`                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Maps to DB table    | Yes (`employees`)                                      |
| Needed for DB access| Yes, required for insert/select via Slick              |
| Contains logic?     | ‚ùå No business logic ‚Äî just field/column mapping       |
| Depends on          | Your domain model (`Employee.scala`)                   |
| Used by             | Repository (`EmployeeRepository.scala`)                |

This file is a crucial bridge between your **pure Scala model** and your **relational database**.
