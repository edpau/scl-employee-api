# ‚è∞ Why I Use DB-Managed Timestamps (`createdAt` / `updatedAt`)

---

## ‚úÖ What I'm Using Right Now

In my current backend project (Play Framework + MySQL), I‚Äôve chosen to let the **database manage timestamps**:

```sql
created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

In my Scala model:

```scala
case class Employee(
  ...
  createdAt: Option[Timestamp] = None,
  updatedAt: Option[Timestamp] = None
)
```

I don‚Äôt manually pass `createdAt` or `updatedAt` during insert or update. The database handles them for me.

## üí° Why This Is Good (Right Now)

Letting the database handle timestamps is a solid approach for early-stage development:

| Benefit                         | Explanation                                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Less logic to write           | No need to update time manually in service/repo               |
| ‚úÖ Always consistent              | DB will never "forget" to update a timestamp                  |
| ‚úÖ Simpler code in insert/update | Just pass the user data ‚Äî DB handles the rest                 |
| ‚úÖ Works well with single DB     | Perfect for MVPs or single-instance deployments               |

This is ideal for me right now because I‚Äôm building a **monolithic MVP**, running on a single server and a single DB.

## üö® When It May Not Be Enough

As the system scales, especially in **distributed systems** or **microservices**, I might need to change my strategy:

| Situation                                     | Problem                                                     | Solution                                |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Writes come from multiple services/locations | Different DBs may have slightly off clocks                  | Use app-level timestamps (`Instant.now`) |
| Testing or mocking time is required          | Hard to "fake" database time                                | Use service-generated timestamps         |
| Audit logs or tracing needed                 | DB timestamps don't track *who* or *what* made the change   | Handle in app logic                      |

So while DB-managed timestamps are great now, I‚Äôll need to be ready to switch when I scale.

## üß≠ Summary

| Aspect             | Choice                     | Reason                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Who sets time?     | ‚úÖ DB                      | Simpler and always correct for now       |
| Where is logic?    | In SQL `DEFAULT` + `ON UPDATE` | Less code, less error-prone        |
| MVP fit?           | ‚úÖ Perfect                 | Fast, reliable, no edge cases            |
| Future change?     | Maybe later                | If I scale into services or need more control |

I‚Äôll stick with **DB-managed** timestamps for now. If I scale up or need app-level auditing, I‚Äôll switch to manually setting them in my service layer using `Instant.now()`.
